        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>It is made with rice cakes (garaetteok, cylinder-shaped 
            rice cake), fish cakes, boiled egg, and seasoned with 
            chile paste. The rice cakes are chewy and tender. It looks 
            super spicy and, originally, it is! But you can control 
            the amount of chile paste. You might be able to find it 
            easily at food vendors on the street of Korea. There are 
            always delicious dukbokki boiling and ready to go. Garnish 
            with sesame seeds if you like.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of cylinder shaped rice cake (tteok), bought or homemade.
                 (Use a little more if you’re not adding hard boiled eggs and fish cakes)</li>
            <li>4 cups of water</li>  
            <li>7 large size dried anchovies, with heads and intestines removed</li>
            <li>6 x 8 inch dried kelp</li>
            <li>1/3 cup gochujang</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp gochugaru</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>3 green onions, cut into 3 inch long pieces</li>
            <li>2 hard boiled eggs (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 pound fish cakes (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Add the water, dried anchovies, and dried 
                kelp to a shallow pot or pan.</li>
            <li>Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat 
                without the lid.</li>
            <li>Combine gochujang, gochugaru, and sugar 
                in a small bowl. Remove the anchovies and 
                kelp from the pot and add the rice cake, 
                the mixture in the bowl, the green onion, 
                and the optional fish cakes and hard boiled
                eggs. The stock will be about 2½ cups.</li>
            <li>Stir gently with a wooden spoon when it starts 
                to boil. Let it simmer and keep stirring until 
                the rice cake turns soft and the tteokbokki 
                sauce thickens and looks shiny, which should 
                take about 10 to 15 minutes. If the rice cake is
                not soft enough, add more water and continue 
                stirring until it softens. When you use freshly
                made rice cake, it takes shorter time. If you 
                use frozen rice cake, thaw it out and soak in 
                cold water to soften it before cooking.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and serve hot. If you have any
                 leftovers, just keep them in the fridge and reheat 
                 them when you want to eat. You should finished it in 
                 a few days.</li>
        </ol>
